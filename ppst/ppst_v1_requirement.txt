Can it change below two alert as one ?

### Step 7: Add Alert Conditions (Optional)
```pine
alertcondition(long_entry_condition, title='Long Entry Signal', message='Long Entry - Price broke above PH')
alertcondition(short_entry_condition, title='Short Entry Signal', message='Short Entry - Price broke below PL')
to new aggregate two alerts as one alert:
define one variable: 
if pp signal is in BUY:
    vTitle= "Long"
if pp signal is in SELL:
    vTitle= "Short"
alertcondition(new_entry, title=vTitle|'Entry Signal', message='< according LONG/SHORT change the msg>')
